Portfolio-type website for photography, using Bootstrap 3

This project is part of a Web Development course I took. This part focuses specifically on Bootstrap 3, and its Grid System.

The main goal was to use this tool to make a simple, beautiful and responsive website on all devices.

It also features a Navbar and Glyphicons.
